# Bank Loan Portfolio Dashboard
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a bank's loan portfolio, presented through an intuitive data dashboard and a detailed executive report. The project aims to uncover key insights into loan performance, portfolio health, and borrower demographics to inform strategic business decisions.

Project Overview
The analysis covers a loan portfolio with $332.3 million in funded loans across 26,900 applications. This project visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs), tracks month-over-month growth, and segments data to identify trends in loan status, borrower employment history, loan purpose, and geographic distribution.

Dashboard Preview
The project features a two-part dashboard that provides both a high-level summary and a detailed overview of the loan data.

Summary View
The summary view highlights top-level KPIs, including total applications, funded amounts, and interest rates. It also provides a clear breakdown of "Good Loans" versus "Bad Loans" (charged off), offering a quick glance at the portfolio's overall health.

Detailed Overview
The overview page allows for a deeper dive into the data, with visualizations for:

Loan applications over time (by month)

Geographic distribution of applications by state

Breakdown of loan purpose, term, and borrower homeownership status

Analysis of borrower employment length

Key Insights from the Analysis
Strong Growth: The portfolio shows healthy month-over-month growth, with funded amounts increasing by 18.64% and applications by 7.14%.

Portfolio Health: A significant majority (85%) of the loan portfolio is classified as healthy ("Good Loans"). However, $50.6 million in funded loans have been charged off, identifying an area for potential risk mitigation.

Primary Driver: Debt consolidation is the most common reason for loan applications, representing a key market for the bank.

Key Borrower Profile: The most common borrower has over 10 years of employment experience, prefers a 60-month loan term, and is likely to reside in a high-volume state like California or Texas.
